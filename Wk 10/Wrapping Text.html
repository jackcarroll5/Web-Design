    <p> "Final Fantasy XV" is expected to be one of the best games of the "Final Fantasy" franchise since "FF VII" as there is a vast open world for players to explore along with
      the group of protagonists that reminds everyone of a boyband.</p>

      <p> The game is finally being released on Tuesday 29th of November 2016 after facing a development that was originally difficult where Square Enix were going to name the game "Final Fantasy Versus-XIII"
       back in the noughties. The game took 10 years to develop which is historic as it is one of the games that took the longest time to create. It joins with the likes of "Gran Turismo 5" and "Duke Nukem Forever"
       as one of the most anticipated games since its development.</p>
